# Doc's Floorp Theme
A WIP theme for the firefox-based browser Floorp.

## A quick warning
This theme for Floorp isn't very polished, there are small inconsistensies everywhere and it is very heavily targeted towards my personal use of Floorp which may not align with yours. Therefore I'm warning you that some things may break if you use Floorp in a different way from how I use it. 

If you encounter any issues or have an idea for improvements, simply open an Issue in the Issues tab here on GitHub or contact me on Discord (username is "docdoozer").

This theme will not work properly on other browsers.

## Instructions
1. If you haven't already, install Floorp from https://floorp.app/en
2. Modify Floorp settings:
   * In Floorp Settings in the "Design"-tab, set the Browser appearance to "Lepton UI". Then press the "Lepton Settings..."-button. In the settings page that pops up choose "Use tweaked Proton design" under "Lepton Settings".
   * temp
3. Install SideBerry Add-on
   * Install SideBerry from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/sidebery/
     (This is what will allow us to use a fancy vertical tab bar)
   * Download TEMP from this GitHub repository.
   * Open SideBerry settings by pressing the cogwheel icon in the top right of the SideBerry side bar.
   * Scroll down to the bottom of the Settings page and press the "Import addon data" button, choose the TEMP file you downloaded earlier.
4. Install Userchrome Toggle Add-on
   * install temp
   * settings temp
5. Customize the Floorp Toolbar
   * First enter the customization mode by right clicking on the Floorp toolbar and then press on "Customize Toolbar".
   * In the bottom left corner, press on "Toolbars" and in the dropdown-menu, hover over "Bookmarks Toolbar" and choose "Never Show". Later we will use a better way of accessing bookmarks.
6. Add the CSS customizations
   * temp

## Alternative tweaks that I recommend
